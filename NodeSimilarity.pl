# * NodeSimilarity.pl             *
# ******************************
#
# This script takes networks obtained from any method and
# it computes two similarity measures between its nodes. 
# A similar method was first proposed in Ahn et al. Nature (2010)
# for clustering links, and we have an implementation in Perl called
# EdgeLinkage.pl, over which this script has been built.
# We consider here a subtle modification of their similarity measure
# to take into account different types of edges. Basically,
# we aim to find communities taking into account that nodes belonging
# to the same community not only share the same partners, but they
# share the same type of relationships between these partners.
# We modify the similarity for both the Jaccard measure (which do
# not consider a weighted network) and Tanimoto coefficients (weighted).
# If your network is not weighted, the weight will be fixed to 1
# and Tanimoto coefficients will be computed accordingly. You should indicate
# this in the "parameters" section of the code. Finally, if your network
# is not weighted but you consider two types of nodes, you should
# provide as "Weight" two values (+1 and +1) and tell to the
# script that the network is weighted.
#
# INPUT: A TAB-separated file describing an undirected network of the format:
#        NodeA   NodeB    Weight  Type
#        "Weight" is the strength of the edge (can be positive or negative, if
#        negative the absolute value will be taken in the computation of the Tanimoto coefficients).
#        "Type" is an integer determining the type of edge (e.g. mutualistic=0, competitive=1).  
#        It accepts an indefinite number of header lines starting with '#'.
#        If the network has no weights, then the file should be formatted simply as:
#        NodeA   NodeB   Type
#
# OPTIONS: -h  Prints a help message
#          -W  equal to 0 if the network is not weighted, to 1 otherwise.
# OUTPUT: A file describing a similarity matrix of the format:
#         NodeA   NodeB   TanimotoCoeff  JaccardCoeff
#
# USAGE: ./NodeSimilarity -W types $path2network
#
#        In addition, if you want to change the order of the input columns you can control it 
#        in the first section "parameters".
