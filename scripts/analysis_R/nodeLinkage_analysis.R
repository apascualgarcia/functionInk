# This script is an example of how to use the function extractPartDensity.R to
# extract the maximum values of the partition densities measures. It is assumed
# that the user is following the Vignette described in the documentation and
# hence that the repository was cloned, and that this script is executed with Rstudio.
# The example is set to be executed in its location in the repository. You should
# otherwise edit the variables root.dir and src.dir to source properly the function.
############################
# USAGE: Provide path and name of the history compact file as indicated below.
# OUTPUT: The step at which the partition densities are maximum, and a summary plot of the partition densities.
